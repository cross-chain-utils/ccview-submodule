NO LICENSE  

This code is currently pre-alpha and cannot be used by anyone other than the author (NTBooks) until it is released.  
I fully intend to release this as open source under a permissive licence once it's stable but it would be unwise to use this is any production projects right now.  
If you would like permission to use this library in your project please visit https://waxworks.io and fill out the contact form or contact @Tantilloon on Twitter.
